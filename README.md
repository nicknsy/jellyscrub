Emby.Plugins
====================

This repository contains many of the plugins that are built and maintained by the Emby community.

Each of the projects has a build event that copies it's output to the programdata/plugins folder. 

By default this assumes you have the server repository side by side in a folder called 'Emby.dev'. If this is not the case, or if you've installed the server than you'll need to update the build events manually in order to test code changes.
